### Content Management

Compatible with links added using [Page Links To](https://wordpress.org/plugins/page-links-to/).

* **Admin Menu Editor / Organizer**. Customize the order of the admin menu and optionally change menu item title or hide some items.
* **Disable Dashboard Widgets**. Clean up and speed up the dashboard by completely disabling some or all widgets. Disabled widgets won't load any assets nor show up under Screen Options.
* **Clean Up Admin Bar**. Remove various elements from the admin bar.
  * Remove WordPress logo/menu
  * Remove customize menu/link
  * Remove updates counter/link
  * Remove comments counter/link
  * Remove new content menu

  * Remove the Help tab and drawer
* **Hide Admin Bar**. Hide it on the front end for all or some user roles.

### Log In / Log Out

* **Manage robots.txt**. Easily edit and validate your robots.txt content.

### Disable Components

* **Disable Gutenberg**. Disable the Gutenberg block editor for some or all applicable post types. Optionally disable frontend block styles / CSS files for the selected post types.
* **Disable Block-Based Widgets Settings Screen**. Restores the classic widgets settings screen when using a classic (non-block) theme.
* **Disable Comments**. Disable comments for some or all public post types. When disabled, existing comments will also be hidden on the frontend.
* **Disable REST API**. Disable REST API access for non-authenticated users and remove URL traces from &lt;head&gt;, HTTP headers and WP RSD endpoint.
* **Disable Feeds**. Disable all RSS, Atom and RDF feeds. This includes feeds for posts, categories, tags, comments, authors and search. Also removes traces of feed URLs from &lt;head&gt;.
* **Disable All Updates**. Completely disable core, theme and plugin updates and auto-updates. Will also disable update checks, notices and emails.
* **Disable Smaller Components**. Prevent smaller components from running or loading. Make the site more secure, load slightly faster and be more optimized for crawling by search engines.
  * Disable the **generator &lt;meta&gt; tag** in &lt;head&gt;, which discloses the WordPress version number. Older versions(s) might contain unpatched security loophole(s).
  * Disable the **Windows Live Writer (WLW) manifest &lt;link&gt; tag** in &lt;head&gt;. The WLW app was discontinued in 2017.
  * Disable the **Really Simple Discovery (RSD) &lt;link&gt; tag** in &lt;head&gt;. It's not needed if your site is not using pingback or remote (XML-RPC) client to manage posts.
  * Disable the default **WordPress shortlink &lt;link&gt; tag** in &lt;head&gt;. Ignored by search engines and has minimal practical use case. Usually, a dedicated shortlink plugin or service is preferred that allows for nice names in the short links and tracking of clicks when sharing the link on social media.
  * Disable loading of **dashicons CSS and JS files** on the front-end for public site visitors.
  * Disable **emoji support for pages, posts and custom post types** on the admin and frontend. The support is primarily useful for older browsers that do not have native support for it. Most modern browsers across different OSes and devices now have native support for it.

### Security

* **Limit Login Attempts**. Prevent brute force attacks by limiting the number of failed login attempts allowed per IP address.
* **Obfuscate Author Slugs**. Obfuscate publicly exposed author page URLs that shows the user slugs / usernames, e.g. _sitename.com/author/username1/_ into _sitename.com/author/a6r5b8ytu9gp34bv/_, and output 404 errors for the original URLs. Also obfuscates in _/wp-json/wp/v2/users/_ REST API endpoint.
* **Disable XML-RPC**. Protect your site from brute force, DOS and DDOS attacks via XML-RPC. Also disables trackbacks and pingbacks.

### Optimizations

* **Image Upload Control**. Resize newly uploaded, large images to a smaller dimension and delete originally uploaded files. BMPs and non-transparent PNGs will be converted to JPGs and resized.
* **Revisions Control**. Prevent bloating the database by limiting the number of revisions to keep for some or all post types supporting revisions.
* **Heartbeat Control**. Modify the interval of the WordPress heartbeat API or disable it on admin pages, post creation/edit screens and/or the frontend. This will help reduce CPU load on the server.

### Utilities

* **SMTP Email Delivery**. Use external SMTP service to ensure notification and transactional emails from your site are being delivered to inboxes.
* **Multiple User Roles**. Enable assignment of multiple roles during user account creation and editing. This maybe useful for working with roles not defined in WordPress core, e.g. from e-commerce or LMS plugins.
* **View Admin as Role**. View admin pages and the site (logged-in) as one of the non-administrator user roles.
* **Password Protection**. Password-protect the entire site to hide the content from public view and search engine bots / crawlers. Logged-in administrators can still access the site as usual.
* **Maintenance Mode**. Show a customizable maintenance page on the frontend while performing a brief maintenance to your site. Logged-in administrators can still view the site as usual.
* **Redirect 404 to Homepage**. Perform 301 (permanent) redirect to the homepage for all 404 (not found) pages.

### 3.9.2 (2023.01.03)

* **[FIXED] Custom Code >> Manage robots.txt**. Fixed ["Undefined variable" issue](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/undefine-variable-field_option_value/) reported by [kwbrayton](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kwbrayton/). Also make this feature work on scenarios where an actual robots.txt file exists, not just the virtual one created by default, by WordPress. In such case, the robots.txt file will be renamed to robots_txt_backup_{timestamp}.txt when this feature is enabled. Vice versa, when the feature is disabled, the backup file will be renamed back to robots.txt, so it will be in use again as it were.
